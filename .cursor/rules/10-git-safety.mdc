---

- Do not execute any VCS operations that modify history or remote state.
- Prohibited commands include (non-exhaustive):
  - `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git cherry-pick`, `git reset --hard`
  - `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, `gh release *`, `gh repo *`
- When asked to commit or push, instead:
  - Provide a proposed commit message and the list of changed files.
  - Offer the exact commands for the user to run locally, but do not run them.
- This restriction applies even if explicitly requested in chat.

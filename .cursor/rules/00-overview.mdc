## Always

description: Core guidelines that apply to all code in this repo
globs:
alwaysApply: true

---

- Follow clear naming (no 1â€“2 letter names). Functions are verbs; variables are concrete nouns.
- Use guard clauses and early returns. Avoid deep nesting.
- Handle errors explicitly; surface user-facing errors via i18n on the client.
- Keep code readable and high-verbosity; avoid clever one-liners.
- For UI strings, always use react-i18next; do not hardcode user-visible text.
- Use `npm run check` to verify large, multi-file changes.
